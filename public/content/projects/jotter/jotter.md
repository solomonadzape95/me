## stack
google gemini, typescript, html, css, monaco editors
## inspo
so, i work at [accave](accave.com) yeah, and part of my job description is creating educational content which includes and is not limited to notes and assessments from recorded audio lessons. so i decided to make it easier and build something for it.

## idea
so the idea was to create an interface capable of accepting audios through drag and drop input fields, process and transcribe them to get their data, and create a set of notes and assessments based on the data from the audio. these would then be rendered in an in-page editor where the user can edit content as they see fit (though over 95% of the content is error-free). the files are appropriately named and can be downloaded after vetting.

## updates?
it would be better if it could automatically get and process audio files directly from teams. this could be possible with some of the ai and agent integrations on teams though i haven't really looked into them that much. will do that if i do find the time.
